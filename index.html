<h1>Yellowstone National Park</h1>
<p>Yellowstone is a unique and special part of the world! It has many amazing geothermal features, due to the supervolcano lying beneath its surface.</p>

<h2>Hot Springs</h2>
<p>Hot springs are the result of natural water heated by geothermal energy. These are dangerous to visitors, as they are often highly acidic and reach temperatures near the boiling point (212Â° F</p>

<h3>Grand Prismatic Spring</h3>
<p>The Grand Prismatic Spring is the largest hot spring in the USA!  The bright colors are the result of microbial mats of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermophile">thermophilic</a> bateria living in the mineral rich water. </p>

<h3>Mammoth Hot Springs</h3>
<p>Mammoth Hot Springs was created over thousands of years as hot water from the spring cooled and deposited calcium carbonate (over <b>two tons</b> flow into Mammoth each day in solution!).

<h2>Large Mammals</h2>
<p>Yellowstone is home to some of the largest land mammals in the USA - the buffalo and the grizzly bear.</p>

<h3>Buffalo</h3>
<p>There are more free-roaming bison in the park than anywhere else in the country. They can grow to be 6 feet tall and up to 2000 lbs!</p>

<h3>Grizzly Bear</h3>
<p>
Compared to black bears, grizzly bears have a much smaller range across the United States. The grizzly bear is typically larger than the black bear and has a large muscle mass above its shoulders; a concave, rather than straight or convex, facial profile; and much more aggressive behavior. Today, the grizzly bear remains in a few isolated locations in the lower 48 states, including Yellowstone.
